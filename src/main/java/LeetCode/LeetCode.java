     * Reverse A String
     * Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
     *
     * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with 0(1) extra memory
     *
     * You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
     * Output: ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
     *
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: ["H", "a", "n", "n", "a", "h"]
     * Output: ["h", "a", "n", "n", "a", "h"]
     *
     * Method with two pointers moving in different directions:
